Substrate Builders Program Milestone Update: December 2022

For the month of January 2022, the Substrate Builders Program milestone update introduces two teams that have reached their first and second milestones.

Over 50 [**Substrate Builders Program**](https://substrate.io/ecosystem/substrate-builders-program/) participants have been continuously completing milestones with support from Parity Technologies as a part of building out the Substrate ecosystem. The program allows teams building Substrate-based blockchains, applications, or ecosystem components to benefit from Parity’s extensive experience and resources, thereby setting themselves up for success.

Projects in the Builders Program are allocated to one of three tracks: the Infrastructure Track, the Chains Track, or the Application Track. Teams accepted into the Substrate Builders Program receive support from Parity on their technical and community roadmaps, outlying major milestones to achieve their goals and launch their project.

## Milestone 1

The following team has completed their **first milestone**. Below we have listed the team’s pre-defined achievements that they have completed.

### Chains track

[**Interlay**](https://interlay.io/) is a decentralized network dedicated to connecting Bitcoin with meta-protocols like Polkadot and smart contract blockchains like Ethereum.

* For their first milestone as part of the SBP, the team at Interlay integrated the Democracy, Collective, Membership, and Society pallets into the chain code, as well as [determined and configured sensible parameters](https://docs.interlay.io/#/kintsugi/governance) for Interlay.
* Implemented the [distribution of governance tokens](https://docs.interlay.io/#/kintsugi/tokenomics) to participants based on their contribution with the help of a modified version of the Scalable Reward Scheme when dealing with changing stake sizes.
* Deployed advanced tests for the new governance model such as upgraded chain on referenda, and recovering chain using governance after possible attack.

## Milestone 2

The following team has completed their **second** milestone since the previous updates we shared. Below we have listed the predefined achievements that have been completed for this milestone.

### Chains Track

[**Apron Labs**](https://apron.network/) is a decentralized platform that provides infrastructure services for dapp developers, dapp users, and operators.

* Completed work on the [**Apron Node**](https://github.com/Apron-Network/apron-node) that enables service providers to be publicly available and on-chain via one-button deployment, through the OCW (off-chain worker) synchronize usage, billing for developers and benefits for providers.
* Deployed testnet, including registration tool for service providers, as well as Apron Contracts.
* Completed [**Gateway**](https://github.com/Apron-Network/apron-gateway-p2p) network manages the services and forwards requests from client to service provider. The network also records service usage for each user, which can be checked by the user or service provider.
