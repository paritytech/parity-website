                These terms of use (together with the documents referred to in it) (the <strong>“Terms”</strong>)
                describe how you may access, browse, use and interact with the Sites. By using the Sites you confirm
                that you accept these Terms and that you agree to comply with them. If you do not agree to any part of
                these Terms, you must not use the Sites.

              <p className="leading-normal">
                When certain words and phrases are used in these Terms, they have specific meanings (these are known as
                &quot;defined terms&quot;). You can identify these defined terms because they start with capital letters
                (even if they are not at the start of a sentence). Where a defined term is used, it has the meaning
                given to it in the section of these Terms where it was defined (you can find these meanings by looking
                at the sentence where the defined term is included in speech marks).

                against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a
