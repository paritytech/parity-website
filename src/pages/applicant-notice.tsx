                <strong>Purpose of This Notice</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                This notice tells you how we use data you submit when you apply for a job or submit to us an application
                for recruitment purposes. It also tells you how you can exercise your rights (including the right to
                object to some of the data handling we carry out). More information about your rights and how you can
                exercise them is set out in the “<strong>Your Rights</strong>” section below.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Why We Collect, Use and Store Personal Data</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                We use information you supply in support of your application (e.g. name, date of birth, email address,
                postal address, contact details, gender, nationality, education information, work history, photos,
                certificates, references) to consider your application and assess your suitability. We use your data to
                our legitimate interests in managing our recruitment based on Art. 6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. f) GDPR and so
                that we can take steps at your request prior to entering into an employment or services contract (Art. 6
                par. 1 s. 1 lit. b) GDPR). If a position that is, or may be, of interest to you requires background
                checks and we therefore need to perform such checks in accordance with applicable law, we will tell you
                about this.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may also obtain data about you from other sources including recruiters, employment research firms,
                identity verification services, the references you provide to us, websites and other publicly accessible
                data on the Internet. To the extent permitted by the applicable law and depending on your future role at
                our company, we may collect details of professional registrations and sanctions with professional
                bodies.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you apply for a position with us or submit information in support of your application, we will tell
                you whether the information we are requesting is essential so that we can process your application or
                whether the supply of this information is optional.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where necessary, we will also use this data to our legitimate interests in accessing appropriate
                professional advice (Art. 6 par. 1 s.1 lit. f) GDPR) and to ensure we comply with legal obligations to
                which our business is subject (Art. 6 par. 1 s.1 lit. c) GDPR).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>How Long We Keep This Information for</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                We usually retain information supplied by job applicants for no longer than it is necessary to process
                your application within the recruitment decision. If your application is unsuccessful we retain your
                personal data in accordance with the applicable retention period depending on the applicable law. We may
                also decide to retain your details for longer if we think you may be suitable for another position that
                may arise in the future, provided you give us your consent (Art. 6 par. 1 s.1 lit. a) GDPR).
              </p>
              <p>
                If your application is successful, relevant information will be used to administer your subsequent
                employment and will be retained and used in accordance with our worker privacy notices (which we will
                make available to you when you take up your employment or begin to provide services).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>How We Share Your Personal Data</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Your data might be shared with other entities for the purpose of assessing your application only. In
                particular, we may share your personal information with Web 3.0 Technologies Foundation (registered
                address Baarerstrasse 14, 6300 Zug, Switzerland), a third party with whom we are not affiliated but with
                whom we cooperate on a range of activities, for the purposes of assessing your application where
                necessary and appropriate for the purposes of our collaboration.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where necessary for the management of our recruitment process, we will share your information with our
                service providers and professional advisers (e.g. recruitment agencies, providers who carry out
                candidate assessment programmes for us).
              </p>
              <p>
                If we have a reasonable interest in verifying the data you have provided (e.g. if there are indications
                that they are incorrect) and we have no other means to check this, we will in accordance with applicable
                law also contact third parties whose details you have supplied for that purpose so that we can verify
                information you have provided in relation to your previous employment history and qualifications.
              </p>
              <p>
                Otherwise, we will not share your information with any third party unless: (a) we have your permission
                (for example in order to share your details with another group company for their recruitment purposes);
                (b) we are required to do so by law; (c) this is necessary so that we can enforce our terms of use,
                rights or property or the rights or property of any third party; or (d) this is (subject to the
                applicable laws) necessary in connection with the sale of our business or its assets (in which case your
                details will be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchaser’s advisers and will be passed to
                the new owners).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>International Transfers</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Where your personal information you send us in support of your application is transferred by us or our
                service provider(s) outside the European Economic Area (EEA), and where this is a country which is not
                subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, we protect your privacy adequately by entering
                into EU approved contractual clauses with service providers operating outside the EEA or a service
                provider’s Processor Binding Corporate Rules. For further information, including how to obtain a copy of
                the documents used to protect your information, please contact us as described in the “Contact Us”
                section below.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Your Rights</strong>
              </p>
              <p>According to the GDPR, you may have the following rights pursuant to Art. 15-18 and 20-21 GDPR:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You may have the right to access your personal data and to obtain a copy of your personal data
                  undergoing processing (Art. 15 GDPR); to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing of
                  your personal data (Art. 16- 18 GDPR); and to obtain the personal data you provide to us for a
                  contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format, and to ask us to share (port)
                  this data to another controller (Art. 20 GDPR);
                </li>
                <li>
                  You may be entitled to object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (where we
                  don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using
                  the data for direct marketing (Art. 21 GDPR);
                </li>
                <li>
                  Where we have asked for your consent, you may withdraw consent at any time (Art. 7 par. 3 GDPR). If
                  you ask to withdraw your consent to processing your data, this will not affect any processing which
                  has already taken place at that time.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                However, there are some{' '}
                <strong>exceptions to these rights under the GDPR and applicable local laws</strong>. For example, it
                will not be possible for us to delete your data if we are required to keep it by law (e.g. where
                retention of your personal data is required by law for tax and bookkeeping obligations) or if we hold it
                in connection with a contract with you. Similarly, access to your data may be refused if making the
                information available would reveal personal information about another person or if we are legally
                prevented from disclosing such information.
              </p>
              <p>
                To exercise any of the above-mentioned rights, you can get in touch with us using the details set out
                below. When addressing us, please always provide your name, address and/or email address as well as
                detailed information about the change you require.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have unresolved concerns, you have the <strong>right to complain</strong> to an EU data
                protection authority where you live, work or where you believe a breach may have occurred.
